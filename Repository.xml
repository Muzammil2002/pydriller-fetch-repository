&#13;
We may decide we want to persist more state through a suspend-terminate-resume cycle (as the app might have done a long time ago). But if we decide we want that, we should not use a persistence mechanism that's closely coupled to frame navigation.</n>

    <n>Remove calcmanager ref (#9)

Calculator (the main app project) depends on CalcManager, but only transitively: Calculator -&gt; CalcViewModel -&gt; CalcManager.&#13;
&#13;
However, Calculator's project file currently has a direct dependency on CalcManager. Let's remove this to make it harder to accidentally introduce new dependencies between the layers.&#13;
&#13;
Also cleaning up some commented-out directives in the CalcManager MSBuild file.</n>

    <n>Don't send AppLifecycle telemetry unless SEND_TELEMETRY is defined (#10)

The app currently logs diagnostic events to ETW in various places. If we add certain flags to those events, the data is eligible to be sent as telemetry. (Whether it actually gets sent is controlled outside of Calculator--for example, there are lots of checks at the system level to ensure privacy settings are honored.)&#13;
&#13;
Currently we set the "eligible for telemetry" flags only in official builds, so no telemetry gets uploaded while the app is in development. We already have this set up for the main TraceLogging provider, but we also need to do this for the AppLifecycle performance logging.</n>

    <n>- Avoid referencing project headers from precompiled headers.

  Before this change, the pchs for CalcViewModel and Calculator project referenced project headers.  If those project headers (or any of their dependencies) were to change, then the pch would be recompiled, slowing local build times.

  By removing references to project headers, the pch will be compiled once and is resilient to changes in the project.  Now that project headers are explicit about their dependencies, when there is a change to a project header only the translation units referencing the modified header will need to be rebuilt.

- Manually tested by ensuring Calculator project builds locally.

    <n>Move the CalculatorManager instance to be direct member data of the StandardCalculatorViewModel class.

Previously, the CalculatorManager was managed with a unique_ptr that was instantiated in the ViewModel's constructor and was never re-assigned.  Objects with long lifetime and larger memory footprint should live in dynamic memory, but the ViewModel itself lives in dynamic memory so that goal is still satisfied by storing the CalculatorManager directly in the class. The change allows the compiler to write a more efficient memory footprint for the same data.

- Verified by testing basic app functionality and running unit tests locally.</n>

- be sure to add a new line at the end of files.&#13;

### Description of the changes:&#13;
&#13;
There are currently 11 copies of the `EMPTY_UNIT` object in the&#13;
`Calculator.exe` binary, which not only wastes space/footprint in the&#13;
binary itself, but also means that each copy must be separately&#13;
initialized, which effects performance.&#13;
&#13;
The reason for this is that the object is defined in a shared header&#13;
file, which then is included by multiple .cpp files, causing each&#13;
translation unit (.obj) to get a full complete copy of the object.&#13;
&#13;
By marking the object as `inline` we can&#13;
instruct the linker to define the object once, as we do&#13;
not need to have 11 unique versions of the EMPTY_UNIT object,&#13;
we only need 1.&#13;
&#13;
The net result is that the `Calculator.exe` binary size is reduced by&#13;
2,560 bytes (or 2.5 KB) with no change in behavior, other than&#13;
the small performance benefit of not initializing 10 redundant copies&#13;
of the object.&#13;
&#13;

    <n>Make 73 numeric constants const, moving them into .rdata (#234)

This change makes the 73 variables in ratconst.h actually&#13;
inline const, which allows them to move from the mutable .data&#13;
section of the executable, and into the read-only .rdata&#13;
section instead.&#13;
&#13;
Moving data to the .rdata section has a number of benefits,&#13;
such as preventing possible corruption due to stray writes,&#13;
or other memory corruption.&#13;
&#13;
Additionally, the initialization at run-time start-up is no&#13;
longer needed, so there is also a reduction in the .text&#13;
(code) section as well.&#13;
&#13;
As a result the overall size of the Calculator.exe binary&#13;
(on x64 Release builds) decreases by 1,536 bytes (or ~1.5 KB)&#13;
with no change in behavior other than a small performance benefit.</n>

    <n>Fix issue with Date diff when it includes a Daylight Saving Time (#193)

The application uses local time to calculate the number of days between 2 dates. If a Daylight Saving Time takes place during this period of time (only Clocks Forward 2am-&gt;3am), the application will miss 1 day and fail to calculate the number of days/weeks/months between the 2 dates.&#13;
image&#13;
&#13;
Description of the changes:&#13;
DateCalculationEngine uses local time to modify dates, however, AddDays, AddWeeks,... won't add 24 hours or 7 days if DST happens between the 2 dates, but instead add ~23.9/24.1 hours or ~6.9/7.1 days (depends if it's the DST clock backward or clock forward). When the DST is clock forward, DateCalculationEngine will miss one day.&#13;
&#13;
Solution&#13;
use UTC dates to calculate date difference.&#13;
&#13;
Extra Fix:&#13;
use calendar-&gt;FirstPeriodInThisDay and calendar-&gt;FirstHourInThisPeriod in ClipTime (else it will set the time to 12PM (noon) in some regions.&#13;

Initial PR for the feature/GraphingCalculator feature branch, part of #338.&#13;
&#13;
The feature incorporates a proprietary Microsoft-owned graphing engine to drive graphing experiences in the Windows Calculator app. Due to the private nature of the graphing engine, the source available in the public repo will make use of a mock graphing engine. See README.md for more details.&#13;
&#13;
This PR simply serves as a base for future feature development. As such, the PR will be immediately merged. Feedback on the content of this PR, and on the feature in general, is encouraged.

    <n>Simplify some of the calc engine string logic (#449)

Description of the changes:&#13;
Currently Calculator handles strings by defining integers for each type of function that can be performed, this integer will eventually correspond with an index in s_engineStrings which holds the corresponding display string for each function. Some functions such as Sin can have multiple strings (degrees, rads, grads, inverse). Functions like Sin are mapped to another array called "rgUfne" where a new integer is given depending on the output string which will then be given to s_engineStrings. The new integer returned by the "rgUfne" array runs the risk of overlapping with any new functions that may be added in CCommand.h. Furthermore, it is expected that the strings in s_engineStrings and rgUfne are defined in a particular order (not necessarily sequential), otherwise the logic will break. This makes adding new strings for new functions confusing and difficult, since a lot of the logic is not clearly defined.&#13;
&#13;
This PR attempts to make this a bit simpler by changing the s_engineStrings and rgUfne arrays to be unordered_maps instead of arrays. For s_engineStrings the keys will now be strings, allowing the existing logic for indexing to be used by simply converting the number into a string to access the value. This will also allow us to create keys in the future that are not limited to integers but to strings that hold more meaning.&#13;
&#13;
The rgUfne array will also be updated to be a map that will take in an integer and give you the corresponding string that can be passed to s_engineStrings. The UFNE object in the rgUfne array will also be updated to hold all the possible string keys for a function, instead of indexing them on other numbers that may overlap with existing definitions.&#13;
&#13;
Now to add a new string for a new IDC_FOO function, we would just need to add the "FooString" resource keys to the g_sids array and use the updated rgUfne map to link the IDC_FOO value to the corresponding "FooString" resource key. This way the resource key can be a meaningful string, and not an integer that must be in any particular order.&#13;

## Fixes #111&#13;
&#13;
&gt; The modulo operator on this calculator gives the result that is different to the most used calculators.&#13;

- add `modrate`, calculating modulo similarly to Matlab, Bing, Google calculator, Maxima, Wolfram Alpha and Microsoft Excel &#13;
- Add `RationalMath::Mod` using `modrate` as an alternative to `Rational::operator%` using `remrate`&#13;
- Add a helper `SIGN` to retrieve the sign of a `Rational`.&#13;
- modify `CalcEngine` to use `modrate` in Normal and Scientific mode and `remrate` in Programmer mode.&#13;

    <n>Compile CalcManager project with or without precompiled headers (#436)

Fixes #324 .&#13;
&#13;
Description of the changes:&#13;
In an effort to support other compilers (#109), this change reworks how precompiled headers are handled. For toolchains where precompiled headers are not used, there is unnecessary compilation cost because each source file explicity includes the pch, meaning all system headers in the pch were recompiled for each translation unit. This change modifies the project's files so that each translation unit includes a minimal set of dependent headers. For MSVC users, the precompiled headers option is still enabled and the precompiled header is added to each translation unit using the compiler's Forced Includes option. The end result is that MSVC users still see the same build times, but other toolchains are free to use or not use precompiled headers.&#13;
&#13;
Risks introduced&#13;
Given that our CI build uses MSVC, this change introduces the risk that a system header is added to the pch and the CalcManager project builds correctly, but builds could be broken for other toolsets that don't use pch. We know we want to add support for Clang in our CI build (#211). It seems reasonable to also compile without precompiled headers there so that we can regression test this setup.&#13;
&#13;
How changes were validated:&#13;
Rebuild CalcManager project. Compile time: ~4.5s.&#13;
Disable precompiled headers, keeping explicit include for pch in each source file. Compile time: ~13s.&#13;
Remove explicit pch inclusion and add the appropriate headers to each translation unit to allow the project to compile. Compile time: ~8s.&#13;
Re-enable pch and include it using the Forced Includes compiler option. MSVC compile time: ~4.5s.&#13;
Minor changes&#13;
Delete 'targetver.h'. I found this while looking around for system headers in the project. It's unused and unreferenced so let's remove it.</n>

    <n>Decrease CPU usage of OverflowTextBlock + optimization (#403)

Fixes #402 and #414&#13;
Divide by 4 the CPU usage of OverflowTextBlock when buttons are pressed very quickly.&#13;
&#13;
Description of the changes:&#13;
&#13;
Xaml-side:&#13;
OverflowTextBlock has some performance issues:&#13;
double scrollviewer: the listview was in a scrollviewer, while the control already containing one -&gt; it breaks the virtualization of the listview and impacts on UI performance.&#13;
The listview used a StackPanel, this panel doesn't support virtualization of ListViewItems contrary to ItemsStackPanel&#13;
&#13;
No ListView-specific features were used, an ItemsControl is more efficient and lighter.&#13;
refactor how we manage the visibility of the left/right buttons in OverflowTextBlock, the new version is more reactive and will not display the right arrow when not necessary (see GIF below).&#13;
remove the ItemContainerSelector ExpressionItemContainerStyle, not really used by OverflowTextBlock&#13;
&#13;
remove UI glitches generated by ChangeView when users type fast (control partially hidden and scrolling issues, see the GIF below).&#13;
only modify the accessibility view when it's necessary&#13;
&#13;
ViewModel-side:&#13;
stop fully refreshing ExpressionTokens in StandardCalculatorViewModel when a new command were sent, instead, use a IObservableVector to only send new tokens to the UI (in average only 1 or 2 UI items are refreshed while the full expression was refreshed before)&#13;

    <n>Handle date difference for ends of months (#553)

The incrementally calling `Window::Globalization::Calendar::AddMonths`&#13;
resulted in a negative value for `GetDifferenceInDays` which was then&#13;
assigned to an unsigned variable `daysDiff`.&#13;
&#13;
One example of the issue when running the calculator in UTC+2 was the&#13;
difference between July 31st and December 30th.&#13;
&#13;
The initial guess was 4 months which then landed on November 30th.&#13;
This date was stored and then in the loop incremeted by one month.&#13;
This then landed precisely on the end date December 30th.&#13;
After the loop the final value is then used July 31st + 5 months&#13;
which results in the 31st of December.&#13;
The resulting difference of -1 days is then assigned to the unsigned&#13;
value `daysDiff`.&#13;
&#13;
This commit makes the minimal changes to remedy this bug.&#13;
It makes sure to only ever call `AddMonths` with the same starting date&#13;
instead of incrementally to different dates.&#13;

    <n>Use 2020 as the major version for the appxbundle (#586)

Calculator's build number in release builds follows the pattern 10.{YYMM}.{build}.0. We use the build number in lots of places, including the app binaries, the app package version, and the app bundle version. Before Calculator moved to GitHub, the app bundle version was generated using a date-based formula which produced versions like "2019.105.612.0". This means that the bundles generated from GitHub have a lower version than previous bundles. This appears to cause some issues during device reset.&#13;
&#13;
This change sets the app bundle major version number to "2020" to ensure that newly-produced appxbundles have higher versions than legacy bundles. The remaining parts of the bundle version number will match the build number for easy reference.&#13;
&#13;
Also updating the MakeAppx version used in bundle creation to 18362.</n>

    <n>Fix #563: Odd dependency cycle (#570)

There is an odd dependency in CalcEngine.&#13;
&#13;
`CalculatorManager` inherits `ICalcDisplay` and implements a set of virtual calls it exposes, in particular `SetPrimaryDisplay`.&#13;
https://github.com/microsoft/calculator/blob/2517854836fee634a273adf3be72371cdb51ddaa/src/CalcManager/Header%20Files/ICalcDisplay.h#L13&#13;
&#13;
When setting a mode in `CalculatorManager`, e.g. https://github.com/microsoft/calculator/blob/2517854836fee634a273adf3be72371cdb51ddaa/src/CalcManager/CalculatorManager.cpp#L208&#13;
`this` (here: an instance of `CalculatorManager`) gets passed as an argument to the newly created `CCalcEngine` as `ICalcDisplay` pointer and the engine is stored as `unique_ptr` member field of `CalculatorManager`.&#13;
&#13;
In the destructor of `CalculatorManager`, a single function is called, `MemorizedNumberClearAll` which then invokes `ProcessCommand(IDC_MCLEAR)` on current engine, gets passed on to `CCalcEngine::ProcessCommandWorker`, to `DisplayNum`, to `CCalcEngine::SetPrimaryDisplay` and finally to `m_pCalcDisplay-&gt;SetPrimaryDisplay`, but here `m_pCalcDisplay` _was_ the instance of `CalculatorManager` that just got its destructor called.&#13;
&#13;

https://github.com/microsoft/calculator/blob/2517854836fee634a273adf3be72371cdb51ddaa/src/CalcManager/CEngine/scicomm.cpp#L133&#13;
https://github.com/microsoft/calculator/blob/2517854836fee634a273adf3be72371cdb51ddaa/src/CalcManager/CEngine/scidisp.cpp#L124&#13;
https://github.com/microsoft/calculator/blob/2517854836fee634a273adf3be72371cdb51ddaa/src/CalcManager/CEngine/scicomm.cpp#L837&#13;
&#13;
It will likely differ by implementation on how exactly, but the [standard suggests](http://eel.is/c++draft/class.cdtor#4) that will invoke the pure virtual `ICalcDisplay::SetPrimaryDisplay`. In case of GCC I believe the vtable is already destroyed by the time you enter dtor's body.&#13;
&#13;
There appears to be no reason to call `MemorizedNumberClearAll` in `CalculatorManager::~CalculatorManager()` because the calc manager and all its engines are going down anyway.  Therefore, removing the call (and thus, the destructor which would then be empty).&#13;

    <n>Restore user preferences (#456)

### Description of the changes:&#13;
**1) Do not set units to default values if they already have valid values** &#13;
This fixes the actual issue. `UnitConverter::InitializeSelectedUnits()` ( this function resets all units to their default units if available for the current category ) gets called after `UnitConverterViewModel::RestoreUserPreferences()` ( this function restores user preferences ).&#13;
So Calculator has been restoring saved values, and then overriding the restored values with default values.&#13;
I modified `InitializeSelectedUnits()` so that we only initialize units only when they are not already set to valid units for the current category.&#13;
&#13;
**2) Removed `m_isFirstTime`** &#13;
I noticed that we are calling `RestoreUserPreferences()`  twice when Calculator starts up, and the function is restoring the same value both times&#13;
&#13;
The below happens when Calculator starts up&#13;
1) On startup, in `UnitConverterViewModel::InitializeView()`, `RestoreUserPreferences()` is called.&#13;
2) `RestoreUserPreferences()` in turn triggers `OnUnitChanged()`&#13;
3) During the first call to `OnUnitChanged()`, m_IsFirstTime is `True`, so we call `RestoreUserPreferences()` again while also setting `m_IsFirstTime` to `False`. &#13;
4) `RestoreUserPreference()` again triggers `OnUnitChanged()`&#13;
5) During the second call to `OnUnitChanged()`,  m_IsFirstTime is `False`, so we call `SaveUserPreferences()`&#13;
&#13;
I think we should only call `SaveUserPreferences()` inside `OnUnitChanged()` since we already restored user preferences during view initialization. I can't really think of a reason to restore units after view has been initialized. This led me to just delete `m_isFirstTime`.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
### How changes were validated:&#13;
Manually tested that units and the current category are properly selected when you quit and start Calculator.&#13;

- Our documentation should make it clear to contributors what the expected developer&#13;

  tests, unaware that they needed WinAppDriver installed on their machine.  This updates&#13;
  the README to indicate that requirement.&#13;

    <n>Prevent Dev title from showing up on Store builds (#627)

Commit 0722781fc updated the app to use `DevAppName` for the&#13;
app's window title when it was a non-official build, based on&#13;
the state of `IsStoreBuild`.&#13;
&#13;
Unfortunately, `IsStoreBuild` is a _project_ level variable defined in&#13;
[build-app-internal.yaml](https://github.com/microsoft/calculator/blob/0722781fc60565938da42ea252766b30d02e5fb5/build/pipelines/templates/build-app-internal.yaml#L36),&#13;
but not a _compile-time_ defined value.&#13;
&#13;
To solve this, we are now defining `IS_STORE_BUILD` in&#13;
`Calculator.vcxproj` when `IsStoreBuild='True'`, the same way that&#13;
we set `SEND_DIAGNOSTICS` for official builds, and we'll change the&#13;
window title based on that new `#define`.&#13;
&#13;
Using this new `#define` can lead us down a slippery slope.  We need to&#13;
limit the amount of divergent code that we have between dev/official&#13;
builds.  This should be hopefully one of very few instances where&#13;
this value is ever used.</n>

&#13;
* PR updates, changed how we detect who has focus so we don't eat keys when not in active tracing.&#13;
&#13;

    <n>Replacing CalculatorVector usage with std::vector (#756)

* Replacing CalculatorVector usage with std::vector&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions made here are that memory allocations&#13;
are not recoverable.  If it can be proved that an index&#13;
will be in range, then the indexing operation is used.&#13;
If not (without manual checks) the std::vector::at function&#13;
is used to throw an exception in case of a programmer bug.&#13;
&#13;
* Changes based on PR feedback&#13;
&#13;
Using auto&amp; in CalculatorCollector::UpdateHistoryExpression&#13;
so the token.first value is properly updated.&#13;
&#13;
Using range for loop to GenerateExpressions.&#13;
&#13;
Setting isEditable directly to the result of boolean expression.&#13;
&#13;
Using token.second directly instead of creating a&#13;
separate tokenCommandIndex variable.&#13;
&#13;
* Fixing issue with generating expressions strings.&#13;
&#13;
A space should not be added before the first item.</n>

## Fixes a bug caused by https://github.com/microsoft/calculator/pull/1426#.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
### Description of the changes:&#13;
- The PR #1426 can cause a crash when no users are returned via `User::FindAllAsync(UserType::LocalUser)` when subsequently trying to access the first user. The existing code also does not guarantee that the returned user is the currently active user.&#13;
- This fix retrieves the user that opened the app and passes this user into a function to check if this user has the proper permissions to access the graphing mode. This makes sense since the active user is indistinguishable (at least from the app's perspective) to the user who opened the app. This user's permissions are then propagated downwards to properly set up the navigation menu of the app.&#13;
- Implementation detail worth pointing out: `s_categoryManifest` is what is used to populate the navigation menu of the app, but this variable is static by design, so a separate function was written to override the appropriate `isEnabled` value in `s_categoryManifest`. This function is called by `onLaunched`.&#13;
&#13;

- The PR #1426 can cause a crash when no users are returned via `User::FindAllAsync(UserType::LocalUser)` when subsequently trying to access the first user. The existing code also does not guarantee that the returned user is the currently active user.&#13;
- This fix retrieves the user that opened the app and passes this user into a function to check if this user has the proper permissions to access the graphing mode. This makes sense since the active user is indistinguishable (at least from the app's perspective) to the user who opened the app. This user's permissions are then propagated downwards to properly set up the navigation menu of the app.&#13;
- Implementation detail worth pointing out: `s_categoryManifest` is what is used to populate the navigation menu of the app, but this variable is static by design, so a separate function was written to override the appropriate `isEnabled` value in `s_categoryManifest`. This function is called by `onLaunched`.&#13;
&#13;
- Manual testing&#13;
